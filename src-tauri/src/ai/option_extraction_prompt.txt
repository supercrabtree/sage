Return ONLY a JSON response with:

Only extract options when the message clearly presents:
- Multiple choice questions
- Several approaches/solutions to choose from
- Different topics to explore  
- Actionable next steps

Examples:
Input: "You could learn React hooks, practice with components, or build a project. What interests you?"
Output: {"hasOptions": true, "options": ["Learn React hooks", "Practice with components", "Build a project"]}

Input: "React hooks are functions that let you use state in functional components."
Output: {"hasOptions": false, "options": []}
